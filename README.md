# This repository contains the latest version of Yoshi Engine **compiled**, along with the changed files for each version.
I named it YC29Engine-Latest cause i'm still not sure of the name, and i wanna pass this as a sort of code name lmao

You can download the engine directly from there by clicking Code -> Download ZIP, files useless for the engine are in the _changes folder.
