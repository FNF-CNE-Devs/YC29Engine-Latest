1.8.0 - New Chart Editor (beta)
Please note that this update was released a bit earlier since ppl were hyped and waiting for the charter for so long, so it may be incomplete.

This update contains a total of 296 files to update, so for some people that may experience slowdowns with the updater, it may be better to update directly from the GitHub page.

- /!\ Engine Renamed : The engine is now named "YoshiCrafter Engine" to prevent any confusion with the character Yoshi.
- /!\ Added a new charter
    - Added ability to edit song scripts and chart scripts in the charter
- Added shaders on sprites in stage editor and on beat tweens.
- Removed the hscript cache since it was taking up on memory and didn't do anything positive
- And a lot more stuff!
